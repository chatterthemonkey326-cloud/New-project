Place the favicon image here

1. Save the provided image (from the attachments) as `favicon.png` in this folder.
   - Final path: `assets/user-images/favicon.png`
2. Preferred format: PNG (square, at least 64×64). For broad browser support you can also create `favicon.ico`.
   - To generate an `.ico` from the PNG, you can use an online converter or a tool like ImageMagick:

```bash
# Example (ImageMagick)
convert assets/user-images/favicon.png -resize 64x64 assets/user-images/favicon.ico
```

3. After placing the file, reload the site and clear browser cache if the old favicon persists.

If you'd like, I can generate `.ico` variants or add multiple sized favicons for best results—tell me if you want that automated.
